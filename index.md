## Chilling Effects : Online Surveillance and Wikipedia Use

In June 2013, Edward Snowden revealed the extent of mass surveillance in the United States. As a result of this, the question arose : Did this news produce a "chilling effect"? In other terms, did Wikipedia traffic for articles on privacy-sensitive topics decrease after the “exogenous shock” of widespread publicity surrounding the surveillance programs in June 2013?

But what exactly is a "Chilling Effect" ?

---

Wikipedia defines it as "In a legal context, the inhibition or discouragement of the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights by the threat of legal sanction"

---

How do we prove this chilling effect exists?

The approach was to analyse the number of views of certain English language Wikipedia articles. The list of articles was chosen from a list of keywords the U.S. Department of Homeland Security uses to track and monitor social media and the most pertinent ones were chosen through a crowdsorcing process.
