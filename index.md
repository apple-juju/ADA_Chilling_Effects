## Chilling Effects : Online Surveillance and Wikipedia Use

In June 2013, Edward Snowden revealed the extent of mass surveillance in the United States. As a result of this, the question arose : Did this news produce a "chilling effect"? In other terms, did Wikipedia traffic for articles on privacy-sensitive topics decrease after the “exogenous shock” of widespread publicity surrounding the surveillance programs in June 2013?

### But what exactly is a "Chilling Effect" ? Wikipedia defines it as:

---

"In a legal context, the inhibition or discouragement of the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights by the threat of legal sanction"

---

### How do we prove this chilling effect exists?

The approach was to analyse the number of views of certain English language Wikipedia articles. The list of articles was chosen from a list of keywords the U.S. Department of Homeland Security uses to track and monitor social media and the most pertinent ones were chosen through a crowdsorcing process.

Respondents were asked to indicate on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being very
unlikely and 5 being very likely):

- How likely they thought they would be in trouble if the U.S. government found out that they accessed information about the topic in question (Government Trouble Rating)

- How “privacy-sensitive” they viewed each topic as (in this case, 5 being highly sensitive and 1 not at all) (Privacy-Sensitive Rating)

- How likely they would be to delete the browser history on their computer after accessing information about the topic

- How likely they would avoid viewing or accessing information on the topic if they knew the Government was monitoring people’s activities online (Avoidance Rating).

The page-view numbers were collected over a thirty-two month period from January 2012 to August 2014, with June 2013 being the interruption.
